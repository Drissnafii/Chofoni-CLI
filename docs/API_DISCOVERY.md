# API Discovery

## How Endpoint Auto-Detection Works ? 

Endpoint auto-detection simplifies the process of discovering available APIs by automatically identifying and listing endpoints. This feature scans the API's metadata or documentation to provide a structured overview of the endpoints, their methods, and parameters.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Scanning**: Detects endpoints without manual configuration.
- **Metadata Parsing**: Reads API specifications like OpenAPI or Swagger.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Reflects changes in the API structure in real-time.

### Benefits:
- Saves time during API integration.
- Reduces errors by providing accurate endpoint details.
- Enhances developer productivity.
